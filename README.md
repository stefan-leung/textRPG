# TextRPG
A python3 text-based RPG without a name. Create an issue to suggest one, you'll get credit!

Feel free to contribute with a pr.

An experiment to create a fast, text-based RPG. No app bundles yet, requires python 3.x (Built on 3.8.x and 3.9.x, untested). To run, put **main.py** and **items.py** in the same directory, and run **main.py**, which can be done with IDLE, on the [repl](https://replit.com/@StefanLuke/textRPG) (above), or on the command line with python.

#### Windows Command Line

``` python [full-file-path] ```

#### MacOS Command Line

``` python3 [full-file-path] ```

##### Make sure you have python 3 installed!
